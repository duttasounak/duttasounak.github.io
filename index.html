				<p>		That dude was born and brought up in the city of Kolkata in the infamous Kidderpore locality. He can be called the Jesus of our times. Like Jesus his birth was also prophesied by Lord Krishna himself. 24th August, 2000 on the day of Janamashtami, he arrived. Now you know where he gets his name from. The Lord's avatar was schooled in St. Thomas Boys School. He later ends up in Jadavpur University. </p>

				<p>		As a young boy, he was alright. No one could guess that this guy would turn out such a charmer (much like his namesake). He passed out of his school with flying colours. Weird things happened during college admissions and he ended up in Jadavpur University. He also got into a relationship. </p>

				<p>		His lectures often hit harder than most professor's lecture in college. If you know you know. ;P Very insighful dude. Probably the most trustworthy and understanding friend we have had. He has the tenacity of a very strong man. He'll always see through what he started and he'll do it with all his might. He'll never give up in tough times himself and always tries to pull up his friends with him. His hobbies mostly include teaching and sleeping at random places.</p>
